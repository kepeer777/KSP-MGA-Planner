# EDIT NOTES FOR CUSTOM SOLAR SYSTEMS

# If your solar system uses Kopernicus' configuration files, you can directly convert them
# into a `bodies.yml` file on this page : https://krafpy.github.io/KSP-MGA-Planner/tools/cfg-to-yml/

# For custom solar systems, the following rules apply to all `bodies.yml`:
# - Follow the exact same format (names, indentations) as used in this file
# - Numerical data must follow the units described above
# - Each body has a unique ID, it must be an integer between 0 and N-1, where N is the number of bodies 
# - The sun must have the ID 0
# - The sun does not have an `orbit` attribute
# - The ID given to a body must be representative of its order in the solar system.
#   For planets, it represents its order from the sun; for sattelites, its order
#   from its attractor body.
#   For example :
#    Body :  Sun | Moho | Eve | Gilly | Kerbin | Mun | Minmus ...
#    ID   :  0   | 1    | 2   | 3     | 4      | 5   | 6      ...
# - The blocks of data describing the bodies in this file must be ordered according to their ID.
#   For example, the sun's data are written first, followed by Moho's data... etc.
